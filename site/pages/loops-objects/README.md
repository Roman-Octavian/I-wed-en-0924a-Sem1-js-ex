# EXERCISE: LOOPS AND OBJECTS

- Create an array of book objects, with title and author (where both are strings).
  Create 5 objects in the array.
- Create an HTML page with a `<ul>`.
- Write javascript that loops over the array of book objects and create a new `<li>` for each book
  object and add the title and author to the `<li>` and insert it into the `<ul>`.
- Verify that it works with any number of objects by removing 2 of the 5 objects from the array and
  run it again.
