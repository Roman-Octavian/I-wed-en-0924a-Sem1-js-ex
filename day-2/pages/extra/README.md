# Extra Exercise

- HTML:
  - Create a `<select>` dropdown with several options representing different items.
  - Add an empty `<ul>` element to serve as the list where items will be added or removed.
- CSS:
  - Style the list and items for better visual representation.
- JavaScript:
  - Add an event listener to the `<select>` element that adds a new `<li>` item to the `<ul>` when an
    option is selected. If the item already exists, it should be removed instead.
