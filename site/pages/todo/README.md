# Todo example

Let us manipulate the DOM and use a todo-page as an example of that.
There should be an input and a button and a ul. When pressing the button, a li should be created in
javascript, its textContent property set to the text in the input and it should be added to the ul.

Can you extend it so you can delete a todo by clicking it?
